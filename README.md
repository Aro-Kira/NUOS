#Database Setup Instructions

##Setting Up the Database

Rename the database file to db_nuos_final.sql (if not already named).

Open MySQL and create a new database with the name db_nuos_final.

Import the db_nuos_final.sql file into the newly created database.

#Troubleshooting

If the new database is not working, try using the old database.

The PHP code might not have been updated, which could cause errors.
